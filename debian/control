Description: IRC file distribution bot, English version

 It uses the DCC feature of IRC to send files to other users. iroffer
 will connect to an IRC server and let people request files from it.
 Unlike similar programs, iroffer is not a script; it is a standalone
 executable written entirely in C, from scratch, with high transfer
 speed and efficiency in mind. iroffer has been known to reach
 6MByte/sec or higher bandwidth usage when multiple transfers are
 occurring at the same time.
 iroffer-dinoex is a fork of iroffer developed and maintained by
 Dirk Meyer <dinoex@dinoex.net>. It offers a lot of enhancements
 and new features, and is backwards-compatible with the original
 iroffer.
